## Main Idea
using the interactive campus map to then tell how crowded the libraries and dinning halls are
### telling how crowded the dinning hall is
For this program, we assume that people typically spend 45 minutes in the dinning hall for lunch or dinner with a random float of 30 min.. Every time a student swipes in the dining hall, the program will count he in for the next x minutes, with the second assumption that he would be in line for the first 5-10 minutes, and eat for the rest of the time. Therefore, the program would aggregate the number of people in queuing and eating respectively, prompting calculated suggestions for users about where to go to have a quick meal. 
#### information needed from the dinning 
we need to know how many people swiped every min
### telling how crowded the library is 
same concept as the the dinning hall but people stay on a scale, on average of 3 hours with a float of +- a bell curve probability ranging from -3 hour to 3 hours
